📝 What Are Containers?
- Containers are objects that store collections of other objects.
- They manage memory, ordering, and access for you.
- Part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL)(Conatiners, Algorithms, iterators,functors(Function Object)).
   *(The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful and essential part of the C++ Standard Library,)
    (providing a collection of generic classes and functions that implement common data structures and algorithms.)
    (It was originally designed by Alexander Stepanov and significantly influenced the C++ Standard Library. )
    (The STL is built upon the concept of templates, which allows its components to work with various data types)
    (without requiring separate implementations for each type. This promotes code reusability and efficiency.)
    


* Think of them like different types of boxes or storage units:
  some are fast for access, some are good at adding/removing elements,
  some keep things ordered, etc.

* Main Types of Containers:

1- Sequence Containers – store elements in a linear sequence

* Examples: vector, deque, list, array, forward_list
* Characteristics:
    -Access by position (index or iterator)
    -Elements can be inserted/removed in specific ways

* Use case: storing lists of items, arrays that can grow

2- Associative Containers – store elements with keys

* Examples: set, map, multiset, multimap
* Characteristics:
    -Automatically sorted by key
    -Fast search, insertion, and deletion (usually O(log n))

* Use case: dictionaries, unique collections, sorted data

3- Unordered Associative Containers – hash-based

* Examples: unordered_set, unordered_map, unordered_multiset, unordered_multimap
* Characteristics:
    -No particular order
    -Average O(1) access
* Use case: fast lookups without caring about order

4- Container Adapters – provide restricted interfaces (stack-like, queue-like)

* Examples: stack, queue, priority_queue
* Characteristics:
    -Built on top of sequence containers (usually vector or deque)
    -Don’t allow random access

* Use case: LIFO/FIFO behavior

⚠️ Common Mistakes When Using Containers

1- Out-of-bounds access
    -vector[10] when size < 11 → undefined behavior.
    -Use v.at(10) for bounds checking.

2- Invalidated iterators
    -Inserting or erasing elements can invalidate iterators (vector, deque).

3- Assuming order in unordered containers
    -unordered_map and unordered_set don’t maintain order.

4- Copying large containers unnecessarily
    -Use references or move semantics to avoid performance hits.

5- Using wrong container for the task
    -Example: list for random access → very slow (O(n)).
