* What is an Abstract Class in C++?

An abstract class is a class that cannot be used to create objects directly. It is meant to be a base class that provides a common interface but doesn't define full behavior.

* What is a Pure Virtual Function?

A pure virtual function is a function declared in a base class that must be overridden in any derived class.

It is written like this:

virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function

- The = 0 means “no default implementation”.
- It forces derived classes to implement the function.

* An abstract class defines what derived classes must do, but not how.
* A pure virtual function is a function with = 0 and must be overridden.
* You can't create objects of abstract classes.
* Useful when you want to define a common interface but let derived classes define specific behavior.
