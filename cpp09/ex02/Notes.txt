Let’s restate the three main steps of the Ford–Johnson (Merge-Insertion) algorithm:
1- Pairing: Make pairs and separate them into:
 - mainChain → larger elements
 - pending → smaller elements

2- Recursion: Recursively sort the mainChain.

3- Insertion: Use binary search to insert:
 - Each element from pending:
 - Plus the leftover (if there was an odd element at the end)
   into the correct position in the sorted mainChain.
